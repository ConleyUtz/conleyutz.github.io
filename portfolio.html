Here you can view my various CS projects from Junior year as well as a little bit of information about myself. Enjoy!</p>

									<h2 class="major">MyUniMarket.</h2>
									<p>MyUniMarket is a revolutionary e-commerce web application that involves students at Purdue University. No one wants to spend more than they have to on school supplies, and MyUniMarket is the perfect second-hand web marketplace for university students. You may view the website <a href="https://myunimarket.herokuapp.com/WebApplication/signin.php">here</a> and experiment with its design. The next panels show the transition from mockup to reality. For full documentation on functionality, check it out on my <a href="https://github.com/ConleyUtz/MyUniMarket/">github</a> page</p>

                                        <p>MoodBuddy was an application created for my Systems Programming class. With just 3 weeks to finish the project, myself and my two partners created a simple yet intuitive application that allows an indvidiual to track their mood, including the strength of their mood and a journal. You can view the video to see a full demonstration of MoodBuddy and its features.</p>

									<p>I'm currently a Senior at Purdue University in the Computer Science program, and I am currently searching for a job in software engineering or security (my two specializations). I'm from the northern suburbs of Chicago but would travel across the entire world if it meant I found a company that was the right fit for me. I continue to do exceptionally well in school and I cannot wait to apply the knowledge I've learned to the real world.</p>
